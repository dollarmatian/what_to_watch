I wrote this app to further refine my development with databases and javascript.
It also really helps to be able to choose something after my brain is already tired from a long day of coding.
A user must register and log in to be able to search, due to affordability
After a user has registered they may search a random movie using some of the search criteria in the search bar.
After a movie is returned a user may click the item to watch now in a seperate window.
The user may also choose to add the item to a watch list.
Each movie item will show comments from previous users who have visited. User who created comment may also delete comment.
The user may view their watchlist which will display all the items in the watchlist.   From there a user may choose to watch and item now
remove and item from the watchlist or view the items page which includes user comments .
